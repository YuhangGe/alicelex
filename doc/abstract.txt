The lexical analysis as an important part of the compiler theory has been widely applied in the production of life. The lexical analyzer auto-generation tool (in English: Lexical Analyzer Generator, LEX) directly from the lexical rule action text converted to the corresponding lexical analyzer source code, simplifies lexer development, facilitate the realization of lexical analysis, in practice also plays an important role. In the traditional language platforms, including C / C + +, JAVA, etc., has a corresponding LEX program.
With the Web2.0 continuous progress and development, especially in the the html5 driven JavaScript language more widely. It is noteworthy that, in the mobile Internet is the main operating system, Windows 8, use the html5 development application (App) developed alongside the development and use C #. So it can be expected, lexical analysis and the LEX program has been widely used in the JavaScript language. However, the lexical analyzer is no a development in the JavaScript language and generate the JavaScript source code auto-generation tool.
Therefore, the development of a JavaScript language on the LEX tool to simplify the lexical analysis tasks on the JavaScript language, it is more necessary. The purpose of this graduation project is to develop an auto-generation tool on the JavaScript language lexer. The main work consists of three parts: First, a LEX tools, tools with traditional lexical analyzer automatically generated function; Second, the particularity of the JavaScript language platform, the LEX tool to optimize and expand so that it can performed on the browser front-end and NodeJS; Third, the tools for packaging, making it an open source project, and its promotion. The first two parts of the above work has been completed, and the third open-source work is further underway.
